# My Python Scripting Journey

Hello!! I have created some Python scripts.

The scripts are organised into folders. Each of the folders contain a .py script and dependant files (wherever required).

* Files in the [SampFunc](https://github.com/deeptikorwar/MyPython/tree/master/SampFunc) folder show you how to use functions and standard libraries
* Files in the [Flowers](https://github.com/deeptikorwar/MyPython/tree/master/Flowers) folder show you how to read files and create a dictionary
* Files in the [Emails](https://github.com/deeptikorwar/MyPython/tree/master/Emails) folder show you how to read files and split the file content into individual batches

To execute a script:
1. Download all files within a folder
2. Open your terminal
3. Type python file_path/file_name.py For example, python ~/Downloads/EmailBatch.py
