# My Python Scripting Journey

Hello!! I have created some Python scripts.

The scripts are organised into folders. Each of the folders contain a .py script and dependant files (wherever required). Some scripts generate output files within the same folders.

* The script in the [C25K](C25K) folder shows you how to use functions and loops
* The script in the [CheckURLs](CheckURLs) folder shows you how to use the standard libraries and check for broken links within the GitHub README.md files
* The script in the [createHTML](createHTML) folder shows you how to convert tab delimited text into HTML output
* Files in the [Emails](Emails) folder show you how to read files and split the file content into individual batches
* Files in the [Flowers](Flowers) folder show you how to read files and create a dictionary
* The script in [insertScript](insertScript) folder shows you how to add a line at the beginning of a file
* Files in the [myTurtles](myTurtles) folder show you how to create objects using classes and how to draw on the screen. Happy drawring!!!
* Files in the [SampFunc](SampFunc) folder show you how to use functions and standard libraries
* The script in the [VariableName](VariableName) folder can be used to check if the short description of a Django variable appears before the corresponding long description of a Django variable.

To execute a script:
1. Download all files within a folder
2. Open your terminal
3. Type python file_path/file_name.py For example, python ~/Downloads/EmailBatch.py
